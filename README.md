Timeless Business Insights: SQL & Python Project
📋 Project Overview
In this project, I explored global business data to answer key questions about the longevity of businesses. I used SQL and Python separately but obtained the same results in both. This demonstrates my flexibility in using different tools for data analysis.

🚀 Key Questions Answered
Oldest Businesses by Continent
Identified the oldest business on each continent and saved the results in a DataFrame (oldest_business_continent).

Missing Business Data by Continent
Analyzed how many countries on each continent lack data on the oldest businesses. Checked if including newer businesses changes this (count_missing DataFrame).

Business Categories Built to Last
Determined which business categories last the longest on each continent, saving the results in the DataFrame (oldest_by_continent_category).

🛠️ Tools Used
SQL: Efficiently queried and analyzed the data.
Python (pandas): Replicated the same analysis to validate the results.
Both tools were used to achieve the same objectives, highlighting my ability to adapt to different environments and tools.
